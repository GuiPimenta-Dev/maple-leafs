# Web Scraping Project for Article Extraction - Maple Leafs maple-leafs Team

This repository showcases a successful web scraping project that involved the development of a tool to extract articles related to the Maple Leafs maple-leafs team from various websites. As a skilled web scraper, I was hired to build this tool to parse multiple websites for specific keywords and retrieve relevant articles. The project was completed within a short-term timeframe, and close collaboration with the client's team ensured that the tool met the required specifications.

## Project Details

- **Objective:** The goal of this project was to develop a script or set of scripts to extract articles about the Maple Leafs maple-leafs team from different websites.
- **Preferred Languages:** The client expressed a preference for using JavaScript, PHP, or Python for the implementation, although other languages were also considered.
- **Server Execution:** The client required the tool to be runnable on their server using a cron job or similar scheduling mechanism for automated periodic execution.
- **DigitalOcean Integration:** Familiarity with DigitalOcean and assistance in deploying the script on their platform were considered beneficial.

## Showcase

This project successfully scraped articles from twenty six different websites, provided by the client. The web crawlers were specifically designed to search for articles related to the Maple Leafs hockey team. The extracted information includes the article URL, title, author, and date published. All relevant data was stored in a database, enabling easy access and further analysis. The Bots are running in Digital Ocean on every 30 minutes searching for new articles.
